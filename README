	ripOLE has now started to become a useful tool in its own
	right, though it is more directly being developed for
	incorporation into ripMIME and subsequently Xamime.

	Needed to have this tool working with other tools I'm already
	using, so I fixed some build errors and created pull request
	on GitHub in a sincere hope that I'm not breaking any licensing
	conditions.

	In case you appreciate my tiny contibution, please consider buying
	me a coffee at https://ko-fi.com/jiripech.

	If you find any errors, please open a new issue, I might later find
	some time to fix it.

	Diclaimer: I did not test '--save-unknown-streams', but tested
	creating a standard .doc file, putting a picture in it and
	extracting the picture from the .doc file.

To check for [and save] attachments in a MS Office file,
	simply do the following:

	./ripole -i officefile.doc -v -d tmp

â€¦and ripOLE will decode the attachments to the 'tmp'
	directory

	-END.
